## Introduction
Intentionally avoiding user-focused statistics here are some data about iNaturalist observations from Czech Republic downloaded before main observation season of 2020. There were **two City nature challenge** campaigns in Prague which boosted obs upload. 

From the 85 726 verifiable obs (28th Feb 2020) there are **52 022 (60.7%) which made it to research grade** and have GPS coordinates available. City challenge 2019 weekend (April) represented top three days (total 4 471 obs, 8.6%) in the Czech observation history.

In total there are **3 994 different observed species**. 32.2% of them are observed only once (i.e. singletons).

Are you coming to this page later in 2020 and do you wonder what is new among observations? Check [iNat page here](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=8264)

**TLDR** 

* Hotspots of observations are in a big cities and protected areas. 

* City Challenge considerably increased number of observations but these are mostly plants and birds. 

* Early spring and late autumn observations are underrepresented.

* Insects, fungi and spiders have potential for increase in the database of research grade obs. More specialists are needed.

## Time aspect
Below is statistics about speed of data upload and verification. Displayed are **means from obs since 2018** which represented increase in iNat usage in Czech Republic (n = 34 269, 65.9% from research grade).

| status | nickname |  days |
|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|    time needed to post obs     | observer efficiency |  13.8 Â± 0.3     | 


## Density of obs
Shows observation density for the whole country. Interestingly, density hotspots are not restricted to bigger cities with a lot of users but are also present in protected areas. This is visible especially in the smaller areas such as Palava and Podyji. Further hotspots are due to locally active users (Ceska Lipa, Novy Jicin, Kromeriz). 

Places with less or no observations are often less visited, not so accessible locations (Beskydy, Jeseniky, Zelezne hory, Cesky Les).

Historical insight. Some observations come from the users' picture archives.

## Observation increase

Histrogram of observations since 2018.

Same data plotted as **cumulative sum** with fitted prediction model. Plato phase starting in autumn 2019 and continuing in winter after City challenge boost is well visible. Model is as follows.

```
count of observations = 72.8x - 10838
```
With the current rate of observation upload the **total number of research grade observations in Czech Republic will be doubled (104K) at the end of April 2022**.

## Seasonal patterns

Total observation sum per month. Main season is from April to June. starting with July the observation number is decreasing towards low values in winter.

## Weekday patterns

Saturday is the best day for observations! Go out and maybe you will meet other observers. Mean values are calculated based on records since 2018.

## Observed organisms

Organisms recorded in the iNat database are grouped into iconic names similarly to the webpage. Upper chart has log-transformed y axis to better display differences in low abundant taxons. Interestingly, mammals are not among top observed groups. Plants are easy to observe they do not run ;) Aves can fly away but their occurrence in the cities is high and are observed often.

Let's look at the **seasonal patterns of the top four observed taxon**. Plants and birds are enriched by City challenge. Insects and fungi are not influenced by campaigns and have expectable pattern corresponding to their occurrence throughout the year.

## Diversity within taxons
Diversity within iconic taxons shows Fungi to be more diverse with lower observations than Aves. Similarly, Insecta are more diverse with much less observation than Plantae. It is easy to observe vast diversity of both Fungi and Insecta.

## More IDs needed

From the 85 726 verifiable obs (28th Feb 2020) there are **25 494 (29.7%) obs without community ID (no research grade)**. 

Who are these? Do we need more specialists on these taxa?
